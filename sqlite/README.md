If you want a clean db, just run `sqlite3 dbname.db` where you replace dbname with any name of your choosing.

So, you could do `sqlite3 pumpkin.db` or `sqlite3 unicorns.db` or `sqlite3 i_am_a_banana.db`.

You'll see something like:

```
TinyAir:daterbasers jess$ sqlite3 i_am_a_banana.db
SQLite version 3.7.7 2011-06-25 16:35:41
Enter ".help" for instructions
Enter SQL statements terminated with a ";"
sqlite>
```

If you want to play a little game, type `sqlite3 ezpz.db`

Then type `select * from discover;` and press enter.
